## Overview

The labs:

  1. `lab1-blink`: get everyone up to speed and all necessary software
  installed.  You do the usual `blink` program by writing your own GPIO
  implementations based on the Broadcom document GPIO description.

  2. `lab2-bootloader`: you will implement your own bootloader to transfer
  the code from your laptop to the pi.  The most common bootloader out there
  uses the `xmodem` protocol.  This approach is overly complicated.  You 
  will do a more stripped down (and I believe) more likely to be correct
  protocol.

  3. `lab3-cross-check`: you will use read-write logging to verify that
  your GPIO code is equivalent to everyone else's.   If one person got
  the code right, everyone will have it right.<br></br>
  A key part of this class is having you write all the low-level,
  fundamental code your OS will need.  The good thing about this approach
  is that there is no magic.  A bad thing is that a single mistake makes
  more a miserable quarter.  Thus, we show you modern tricks for ensuring
  your code is correct.

  4. `lab4-uart`: you write your first real device driver, for the UART,
  using only the Broadcom document.  At this point, all key code on the pi
  is written by you.

  5. `lab5-replay`: in a twist on lab3, you will use Unix system calls
  to interpose between your Unix and pi bootloader code, record all reads
  and writes, and test your bootloader implementation by replaying these
  back, both as seen and with systematic corruption.<br></br>
  This approach comes from the model-checking community, and I believe
  after you implement this lab and test (and fix) your bootloader you
  will be surprised if it breaks later.  (In general, the approach
  we follow here applies well to other network protocols which have
  multi-step protocols and many potential failure modes, difficult to
  test in practice.)

  6. `lab6-virtualization`: this lab will show how to virtualize hardware.
  We will use simple tricks to transparently flip how your pi code is
  compiled so you can run it on Unix, only shipping the GPIO reads
  and writes to a small stub on the pi.  As a result, you have full
  Unix debugging for pi code (address space protection, valgrind, etc)
  while getting complete fidelity in how the pi will behave (since we
  ship the reads and writes to it directly).
  
  7. `lab7-interrupts`: you will walk through a simple, self-contained
  implementation of pi interrupts (for timer-interrupts), kicking each
  line until you understand what, how, why.  You will use these to 
  then implement a version of `gprof` (Unix statistical profiler) in about
  30 lines.<br></br>
  Perhaps the thing I love most about this course is that because we
  write all the code ourselves, we aren't constantly fighting some
  large, lumbering OS that can't get out of its own way.  As a result,
  simple ideas only require simple code.  This lab is a great example:
  a simple idea, about twenty minutes of code, an interesting result.
  If we did on Unix could spend weeks or more fighting various corner
  cases and have a result that is much much much slower and, worse,
  in terms of insight.

  8. `lab8-sonar-int`: we take a bit of a fun break, and bang out a
  quick device driver for a simple sonar device. You will then get
  a feel for how interrupts can be used to simplify code structure
  (counter-intuitive!)  by adapting the interrupt code from the previous
  lab to make this code better.

  9. `lab9-threads`: we build a simple, but functional threads package.
  You will write the code for non-preemptive and preemptive context
  switching.  Most people don't understand such things so, once again,
  you'll leave lab knowing something many do not.
